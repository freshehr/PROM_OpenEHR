# 3. Build a CDR service

In this section we will start to develop a service to allow us to interact with the CDR, strting with authorisation and listing templates. We will use the React harness to display th results and start building some React components for particular parts of the interaction.

## Authorisation

As mentioned inthe previous article we currently have to cope with 2 approaches to Authorisation, one using Basic Auth and the other Session tokens, spending on the type of CDR.

First of all let's setup some objects to capture the basic setup information for a couple of CDRs.


Create a new folder under ./src called 'services' and then two new files in 'services' called `cdr-service.js` and `cdrConfigs.js`

Add the following to `cdrConfigs.js` 

```javascript
const cdrConfigs = [
    {
        name: 'c4h_nutshell',
        type: 'thinkehr',
        url: 'https://cdr.code4health.org',
        username: 'ianmcnicoll_98aa716e-8bc6-40f6-a5a3-84518c4c60ef',
        password: '$2a$10$7RUqg',
    },
    {
        name: 'ethercis_cloud',
        type: 'ethercis',
        url: 'http://178.62.71.220:8080',
        username: 'guest',
        password: 'guest',
    }
];
export default cdrConfigs;    
```

This will allow us to switch between different CDRs of different types to test any differences.
